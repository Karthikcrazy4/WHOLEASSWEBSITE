How to write a README. I dont know but ill explain what i did in the code in snippets i guess:
 I have created a webpage
 then i used javascript and also HTML/CSS to link whatever bullshit i needed to make.
 i first created a loading animation that is from line 258 to 266 and more but yea i watched this youtube video to do it, so watch that if you wanna do it as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGok4UIqu8E&list=PL5e68lK9hEzeeXtsQCQYd9SAzj6u6wZpi&index=5
 I added my own fucking creativity to the following webpage so don't mind just copy and paste the fucking code if you dont understand
 then pretty much created the main page i.e the box of signups imma get.
 from line 267 to 314 in the PAGE code is the following contents.
 I then created the extra information bullshit that needed to be added i.e all the paragraphs and all the necessary requirements
 that is the reamning code untill now will update later.
